                in Little Rock, Arkansas. Established as Little Rock Junior College by the Little Rock
                School District in 1927, the institution became a private four-year univeristy under the

                Rock Junior College is now (2019) the campus of Philander Smith University.

                    The student life at UA Little Rock is typical of public universities 
                    in the United States. It is characterized by student-run organizations 
                    and affiliation groups that support social, academic, athletic, and 
                    religious activities and interests. Some of the services offered by the UA 
                    Little Rock Office of Campus Life are intramural sports and fitness programs, 
                    diversity programs, leadership development, peer tutoring, student government 
                    association, student support programs including groups for non-traditional 
                    and first-generation students, a student-run newspaper, and fraternity and 
                    sorority life. The proximity of the UA Little Rock campus to downtown Little 
                    Rock enables students to take advantage of a wide array of recreational, 
                    entertainment, educational, internship, and employment opportunities that 
                    are not available anywhere else in Arkansas.<sup><a href="">[20]</a></sup>

                    UA Little Rock's 14 athletic teams are known as <em>the Little Rock 
                    Trojans</em>, with almost all teams participating in the Sun Belt Conference. 
                    Little Rock is one of two Sun Belt members that do not sponsor football 
                    (UT Arlington being the other); UA Little Rock last fielded a football 
                    team in 1955 when it was known as Little Rock Junior College. Little Rock's 
                    main athletic offices are located in the Jack Stephens Center. UA Little Rock 
                    offers the following sports:

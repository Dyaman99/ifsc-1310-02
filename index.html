    <h2>Thoughts on Web Accessibility</h2>
    <p><strong>Web accessibility</strong> is making sure that the website you are building is usable by everyone.
    This means considering people with disabilities and adding features, such as audio descriptions and subtitles, while creating your website.
    Web accessibility also means creating web sites that users are able to use in an efficient and unchallenging way. </p>

    <p><em>Why is it important to build accessible web sites?</em> Creating accessible web sites are important because by doing so, 
    you are able to offer a comrehensive or inclusive experience for the greatest possible number of people. Therefore, web accessibility is important
    because it ensures everyone has equal access to the content and information on the website, visitors have a user-freindly experience, and 
    people with disabilities have assistance for using the website without limitations.</p>

    <h2>Progressive Enhancement</h2>
    <p>Progressive enhancement is building and designing websites keeping in mind that every user may have different needs and wants. Progressive enhancement takes content as its core or most essential component in a website. This is because every user will need the content; it is the main reason why we create websites. Therefore, the goal is to markup the content in rich and semantic HTML. Second most important part is the design or presentation. While some people may just want the content, other people like to see more beautiful and polished presentation of the content. That is when the CSS comes in. Finally, after HTML and CSS are functioning pretty well, we can then add JavaScript. Javascript is used to make the user experience more engaging. So, based on this approach, the website is built in layers which turn on based on browser's capabilities, ensuring that the website will work for everyone.

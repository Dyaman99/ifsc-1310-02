      <h2>Thoughts on Web Accessibility</h2>
      <p><strong>Web accessibility</strong> is making sure that the website you are building is usable by everyone.
      This means considering people with disabilities and adding features, such as audio descriptions and subtitles, while creating your website.
      Web accessibility also means creating web sites that users are able to use in an efficient and unchallenging way. </p>

      <p><em>Why is it important to build accessible web sites?</em> Creating accessible web sites are important because by doing so, 
      you are able to offer a comrehensive or inclusive experience for the greatest possible number of people. Therefore, web accessibility is important
      because it ensures everyone has equal access to the content and information on the website, visitors have a user-freindly experience, and 
      people with disabilities have assistance for using the website without limitations.</p>

    <div id="progressive-enhancement">
      <h2>Progressive Enhancement</h2>
      <p>Progressive enhancement is building and designing websites keeping in mind that every user may have different needs and wants. Progressive enhancement takes content as its core or most essential component in a website. This is because every user will need the content; it is the main reason why we create websites. Therefore, the goal is to markup the content in rich and semantic HTML. Second most important part is the design or presentation. While some people may just want the content, other people like to see more beautiful and polished presentation of the content. That is when the CSS comes in. Finally, after HTML and CSS are functioning pretty well, we can then add JavaScript. Javascript is used to make the user experience more engaging. So, based on this approach, the website is built in layers which turn on based on browser's capabilities, ensuring that the website will work for everyone. This is the <a href="https://piccalil.li/blog/its-about-time-i-tried-to-explain-what-progressive-enhancement-actually-is/"> link to the article</a> I found and read.</p>

      <h2>Final Project Revision and Reflection</h2>
      <h3>Feedback from my brother</h3>
      <p>The display of content and images were really good, however, the font was a bit small and pages felt too empty when all the quality content was barely covering anything on the screen. The "about" page lacked style and a personal touch. The footer feels bland. The things in footer could've been better styled and organized. Overall keeps it professional and straight forward, could use some creativity and improvements here and there. </p>
      <h3>My Reflection</h3>
      <p>I have learned a lot of valuable information on how to build accessible and progressive websites. Before I took this class, I had previous knowledge about coding with HTML and CSS. However, through this course I was able to add more to that knowledge and practice it by creating multiple websites. This final project was my first ever website with multiple pages and interactive content. I generated my own content and my own logo using various web-applications, such as canva. I believe I did pretty well in creating my logo, building a well structured website, and adding consistent styles accross my pages. I was able to accomplish these because we learned the step-by-step process of building a functioning website. However, I struggled with incorporating JavaScript into my project. But, after some trial and error, I found a way to make JavaScript work for my content. I also wanted to add a parallax image, I tried many different ways to do it, but none of them actually worked. So, if I would start over, I would attend the lab sessions provided by this course to get help with adding parallax images and some other advanced features. After my brother's feedback I decided to add a picture on the about page because what he said was true. But I think the footer is simplistic and it looks professional. I like the way it looks very much and I believe it suits the website content, so I did not change the footer. </p>

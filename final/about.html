    <h2>Our Story</h2>
    <p>Pottery Palette began as a shared dream between two college friends, Daisy and Susan, who wanted to create something truly unique for their community. Daisy, an artist with a lifelong passion for creativity, had always dreamed of owning her own business. She envisioned a space where people could explore their artistic side, connect with others, and leave with something beautiful they created themselves.</p>
    <p>While Daisy had the creative vision, she knew she needed help turning her dream into reality. That’s where Susan came in. With a background in business management and a knack for organization, Susan brought the structure and expertise needed to launch and grow their studio. Together, they combined their talents—Daisy’s artistic passion and Susan’s business skills—to create a space where creativity and fun come together.</p>
    <p>Since opening Pottery Palette, Daisy and Susan have worked tirelessly to make the studio a place where everyone feels welcome, whether they’re painting their first mug, hosting a party, or learning the art of pottery-making. What started as an idea between friends has blossomed into a vibrant part of the Little Rock community, and the story is just beginning.</p>
